# Tie-Line Manager

A cross-platform Electron application that connects two broadcast video routers and manages tie-lines between them, presenting them as a single unified virtual router. Operators can route any source from either router to any destination on either router seamlessly through the virtual crosspoint matrix.

## What Are Tie-Lines?

In broadcast environments, tie-lines are dedicated physical connections between two routers that allow signals to pass from one router to the other. For example, if Router A has cameras and Router B has monitors, a tie-line carries a camera signal from Router A's output into Router B's input, making it available to Router B's destinations.

Tie-Line Manager automates this process:
- Configures which ports on each router serve as tie-lines
- Hides tie-line ports from the operator's view
- Automatically allocates tie-lines when cross-router routes are requested
- Presents both routers as one seamless virtual router

## Latest Release: v1.7.0

Download the latest installers from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/videojedi/TieLineManager/releases/latest) page.

## Installation

### Building from Source

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later
- npm

#### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/videojedi/TieLineManager.git
cd TieLineManager

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start

# Build for your platform
npm run build:mac   # macOS
npm run build:win   # Windows
```

## Usage

### 1. Connect Routers

Enter the IP address and port for each router (A and B), select the protocol, and connect. Both routers must be connected before tie-lines can be configured.

### 2. Configure Tie-Lines

Switch to the **Tie-Lines** tab to define which physical ports serve as tie-lines between the routers:

- **A→B Tie-Lines**: Select a Router A output and Router B input pair
- **B→A Tie-Lines**: Select a Router B output and Router A input pair
- Add as many tie-lines as needed in each direction (more tie-lines = more simultaneous cross-router routes)

### 3. Route Signals

Switch to the **Routing** tab to see the unified virtual router. The XY grid shows all non-tie-line inputs and outputs from both routers:

- Click a crosspoint to make a route
- Drag across crosspoints for sequential routing
- Routes within the same physical router are made directly
- Routes between routers automatically use an available tie-line

### 4. Salvos

Switch to the **Salvos** tab to capture and recall routing presets:

- Select destinations from the left column
- Click **Capture Selected** or **Capture All** to save the current routing state
- Click a saved salvo to recall it
- Export/import salvos as CSV files

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode (with DevTools)
npm run dev
```

## Troubleshooting

### "ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE" Error

If you see errors about Electron running as Node, the start script handles this automatically. If issues persist:

```bash
unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && npm start
```

### Cross-Router Routes Failing

- Ensure tie-lines are configured in the correct direction
- Check that tie-line ports are not already in use (view tie-line status in the Tie-Lines tab)
- Verify both routers are connected

### Routes Not Appearing

- Both routers must be connected for the virtual router to display
- If a router reconnects, tie-line state is automatically reconstructed from physical routing
